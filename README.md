# CS452 - Parallel Algorithms

## Project 1 - Intro to parallel

Getting use to parallel

1. P1Whack -> Getting familiar with things like MPI_Sum, MPI_Max, etc.
2. P1Rings -> Getting familiar with MPI_Send and Recv to pass "baton" from processor to processor
3. P1Eye -> For a given text file, count the number of times every letter appears

## Project 2 - Parallel Mergesort

Implementation of Parallel MergeSort Algorithm

## Project 3 - 2-3 Trees

Work in progress, inserting of nodes is complete, but deletion is still being worked on
