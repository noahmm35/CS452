## CS452: Parallel Algorithms

### Projects Above:

1. [Project 1](https://github.com/noahmm35/CS452/tree/main/Project1)

    Introduction to parallel programming/ MPI
    
        P1Eye -> For a given text file, count the number of times each letter appears in parallel (MPI_Scatter, Reduce, Allreduce)
    
        P1Rings -> Pass a "baton" from processor to processor (MPI_Send, Recv)
    
        P1Whack -> Finding max, min, average of large array in parallel (MPI_Scatter, Max, Min, etc)
    
2. [Parallel Mergesort](https://github.com/noahmm35/CS452/tree/main/Project2)

   Implementation of parallel mergesort algorithm for array of integers

3. **Work in Progress** - [2-3 Trees](https://github.com/noahmm35/CS452/tree/main/Project3)

   Sequential implementation of 2-3 trees
   
   Insertion works, deletion is not quite finished
